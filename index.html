        <p>Hi there, and welcome to my photography gallery! My name is Maham, and I live in Glasgow, Scotland. One of my favourite hobbies is photography, which I have loved since 2017. By all means, I am not a professional, but I enjoy capturing different things that interest me such as, the sky, architechtural buildings, nature, and flowers. Therefore, the purpose of this website is simply a gallery to showcase some of my favourite images which I have decided to group into themes, so I hope you enjoy!</p>
        <h3>Islamic Buildings:</h3>
        <p>First, below is a slideshow of some of my favourite Islamic buildings that I have captured from my travels to Medina and Mecca in Saudia Arabia as well as Istanbul, Turkey.</p>

            <img src="images/bluemosque.jpg" alt="inside blue mosque"; width="300" height="auto">

          <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li><b>12/01/2024: Masjid al Nabwi or the Prophet Muhammad PBUH's Mosque, Medina, Saudia Arabia.</b> This is the 2nd most holiest mosque in Islam. 2 million Muslims come to pray in this very mosque as this is where the Prophet Muhammad's tomb is located.</li>
            <li><b>11/01/2024: Masjid al Haram, Mecca, Saudia Arabia.</b>This is one of the oldest and largest mosques built in history and accommodates millions of pilgrims from all over the world throughout the year.</li>
            <li><b>03/07/2023; Hagia Sophia/Aya Sophia Mosque, Istanbul, Turkey.</b> The Hagia Sophia was originally built as a cathedral in 537AD during the Byzantine Empire and became the largest Christian church in the world at the time. After the Ottoman conquest in 1453, it was converted into a mosque, and in 1935 until 2020, when it was reconverted into a mosque. </li>
            <li><b>03/07/2023; Blue Mosque/Sultan Ahmed Mosque, Istanbul, Turkey.</b> The Blue Mosque has six minarets which initially caused controversy, as it matched the number of minarets of the Masjid al Haram </li>
            <li><b>02/07/2023; Yeni Mosque, Istanbul, Turkey.</b> Yeni means "New" in Turkish because it was a new mosque when it was built. It took 66 years to build between the years of 1597-1663 because of interruptions such as financial problems, earthquakes, fires, and engineering problems due to being built just next to the water</li>
            <li><b>02/07/2023; Süleymaniye Mosque, Istanbul, Turkey.</b> During the time of construction, Suleiman I, also known as Suleiman the Magnificent, sought out to use this mosque and go against the Hagia Sophia in terms of being bigger in size. However, it ended up being smaller than the Hagia Sophia measuring up to 59m long and 58m wide, the main dome being 53m high and 27m in diameter</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>12/09/2020: Glasgow Botanic Gardens - The Kibble Palace</h3>
        Below are some of my favourite plants I captured during my 2020 trip to the Kibble Palace which is located within the Glasgow Botanic Gardens based in the West-End of Glasgow.

    <h3>Flowers</h3>
    Saving the best for last—flowers! Capturing the intricate details of flowers is one of my favorite things to do as I love to look at the unique features each flower possesses
